# Welcome to [Astro](https://astro.build) Stargazers ⭐️

🚀 YOUR CHALLENGE, SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO ACCEPT IT
Build a Star Gazer App!

In this month's challenge, we’ll be building a [Star Gazer app that leverages one of NASA's amazing APIs](https://prismic.io/blog/astro-js-tutorial?utm_source=newsletter_august_2022&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=optimized_dev&utm_content=inline) and Astro's awesome benefits.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Image.svelte
│   │   └── Carousel.svelte
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components or layouts.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                             |

| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`        |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`            |
