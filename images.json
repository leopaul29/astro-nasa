[{"date":"1996-04-16","explanation":"Four hundred fifty light-years from Earth, the wind from a dying, sun-like star produced a planetary nebula popularly known as the Helix. While exploring the Helix's gaseous envelope with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), astronomers discovered indications of 1,000s of striking \"cometary knots\" like those shown above. So called because of their resemblence to comets, they are actually much larger - their heads are several billion miles across (roughly twice the size of the our solar system itself) while their tails, pointing radially away from the central star, stretch over 100 billion miles. Previously known from ground based observations, the sheer number of cometary knots found in this single nebula is astonishing. What caused them to form? Hot, fast moving shells of nebular gas overrunning cooler, denser, slower shells ejected by the star during an earlier expansion may produce these droplet-like condensations as the two shells intermix and fragment. An intriguing possibility is that instead of dissipating over time, these objects, could collapse and form pluto-like bodies. If so, these icy worlds created near the end of a star's life, would be numerous in our galaxy.

Sirius is visible on the far left of the above photograph, to the left of the constellation of Orion and Comet Hale-Bopp.  Intrinsically, Sirius is over 20 times brighter than our Sun and over twice as massive.  As Sirius is 8.7 light years distant, it is not the closest star system - the Alpha Centauri system holds this distinction.  Sirius is called the Dog Star because of its prominence in the constellation of Canis Majoris (Big Dog).  In 1862, Sirius was discovered to be a binary star system with a companion star, Sirius B, 10,000 times dimmer than the bright primary, Sirius A.  Sirius B was the first white dwarf star discovered, a type of star first understood by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in 1930.  While studying Sirius in 1718, Edmond Halley discovered that stars move with respect to each other.  There is conflicting evidence that Sirius appeared more red only 2000 years ago.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0006/siriushb_jcc_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Sirius: The Brightest Star in the Night","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0006/siriushb_jcc.jpg"},{"copyright":"Magnus Edback","date":"2018-12-21","explanation":"Welcome to the December Solstice, the first day of winter in planet Earth's northern hemisphere and summer in the south. To celebrate, consider this extraordinary display of beautiful solar ice halos! More common than rainbows, simple ice halos can be easy to spot, especially if you can shade your eyes from direct sunlight. Still it's extremely rare to see anything close to the complex of halos present in this astounding scene. Captured at lunchtime on a cold December 14 near Utendal, Sweden the image includes the relatively ordinary 22 degree halo, sundogs (parhelia) and sun pillars. The extensive array of rarer halos has been identified along with previously unknown features. All the patterns are generated as sunlight (or moonlight) is reflected and refracted in flat six-sided water ice crystals in Earth's atmosphere. In this case, likely local contributors to the atmospheric ice crystals are snow making machines operating at at nearby ski center.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1812/IMG_8741_cSunHaloEdback2048.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Extraordinary Solar Halos","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1812/IMG_8741_cSunHaloEdback1024.jpg"},{"copyright":"John P.

As a result, two fuzzy cloud-like objects easily visible to southern hemisphere skygazers are known as the Clouds of Magellan, now understood to be satellite galaxies of our much larger, spiral Milky Way galaxy. About 160,000 light-years distant in the constellation Dorado, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is seen here in a remarkably deep, colorful composite image, starlight from the central bluish bar contrasting with the telltale reddish glow of ionized atomic hydrogen gas. Spanning about 15,000 light-years or so, it is the most massive of the Milky Way's satellite galaxies and is the home of the closest supernova in modern times, SN 1987A.  The prominent patch at top left is 30 Doradus, also known as the magnificent Tarantula Nebula.

That is because Monfrag�e National Park in Spain, where this composite image was created, has recently had its night sky officially protected from potential future light pollution.  Icons of the night sky that should continue to stand out during northern winter -- and are visible on the featured image -- include very bright stars like Sirius, Betelgeuse, and Procyon, bright star clusters like the Pleiades, and, photographically, faint nebulas like the California and Rosette Nebulas.  Even 100 years ago, many people were more familiar with a darker night sky than people today, primarily because of the modern light pollution.  Other parks that have been similarly protected as dark-sky preserves include Death Valley National Park (USA) and Grasslands National Park (Canada).

The Red Spider Planetary Nebula shows the complex structure that can result when a normal star ejects its outer gases and becomes a white dwarf star. Officially tagged NGC 6537, this two-lobed symmetric planetary nebula houses one of the hottest white dwarfs ever observed, probably as part of a binary star system.  Internal winds emanating from the central stars, visible in the center, have been measured in excess of 1000 kilometers per second. These winds expand the nebula, flow along the nebula's walls, and cause waves of hot gas and dust to collide.  Atoms caught in these colliding shocks radiate light shown in the above representative-color picture by the Hubble Space Telescope.  The Red Spider Nebula lies toward the constellation of the Archer (Sagittarius).  Its distance is not well known but has been estimated by some to be about 4,000 light-years.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1210/redspider_milovic_1476.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Red Spider Planetary Nebula","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1210/redspider_milovic_960.jpg"},{"date":"2015-06-20","explanation":"\"Beautiful Nebula discovered between the Balance [Libra] & the Serpent [Serpens] ...\" begins the description of the 5th entry in 18th century astronomer Charles Messier's famous catalog of nebulae and star clusters. Though it appeared to Messier to be fuzzy and round and without stars, Messier 5 (M5) is now known to be a globular star cluster, 100,000 stars or more, bound by gravity and packed into a region around 165 light-years in diameter. It lies some 25,000 light-years away. Roaming the halo of our galaxy, globular star clusters are ancient members of the Milky Way. M5 is one of the oldest globulars, its stars estimated to be nearly 13 billion years old. The beautiful star cluster is a popular target for Earthbound telescopes. Of course, deployed in low Earth orbit on April 25, 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope has also captured its own stunning close-up view that spans about 20 light-years near the central region of M5. Even close to its dense core at the left, the cluster's aging red and blue giant stars and rejuvenated blue stragglers stand out in yellow and blue hues in the sharp color image.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1506/m5hst2048.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Hubble's Messier 5","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1506/m5hst950.jpg"},{"date":"2012-07-10","explanation":"What are these humans doing?

Happiness and dancing transcend political boundaries and occur in practically every human society. Above, Matt Harding traveled through many nations on Earth, planned on dancing, and filmed the result.  The above  video, the latest in a series of similar videos, is perhaps a dramatic example that humans from all over planet Earth feel a common bond as part of a single species.

This cosmological dust was recently discovered in data taken previously by the COBE satellite, and visible as a diffuse glow visible in the above image.  The amount of dust in the universe is important because it is a measure of the number of stars that created it, of the number of stars that are cloaked by it, and of the amount of distortion created in measurements of the distant universe.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9801/dustsky_cobe_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Our Dusty Universe","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9801/dustsky_cobe.jpg"}]
